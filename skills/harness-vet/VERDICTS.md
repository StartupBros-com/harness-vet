# Verdicts

## Vocabulary: component by target

Keep verdict, placement, activation and evidence status separate. A skill can
be SKIP globally and ADOPT in a project without contradicting itself. Include
an unresolved target row when no destination is defensible; missing scope is
not an empty assessment.

- **ADOPT**: use as-is at the recorded supported placement; verified utility
  exceeds target-specific cost. A native project install is ADOPT, not ADAPT
  merely because it is narrower than global.
- **ADAPT**: utility is demonstrated but delivery must change. Name the exact
  change: select permitted components, remove an updater, alter activation,
  patch/fork packaging, or convert a global-only installer to project-local.
  Prefer a native scoped plugin install when it suffices. If per-component
  controls are unavailable, price the whole enabled bundle or explicitly
  adapt it; never invent a per-skill switch or assume all platforms lack one.
  A copied-out component runs standalone in the phase-4 sandbox, every
  outside-directory reference resolved, before ADAPT is rendered.
- **EXTRACT**: port a useful pattern, not the candidate's implementation, into
  the target's idiom. Behavior-shaping ports need a live-task result before
  landing or an explicit unverified-value marker with its deciding measurement.
  Absence from the incumbent is not itself evidence of value.
- **SKIP**: equivalent capability is already usable for the target task, no
  demonstrated need exists, or costs exceed benefit. A broad topic/name match
  alone is not duplication. Callable global on-demand tools count; disabled,
  inaccessible or other-project-only copies do not automatically count. Judge
  coverage at the grain of the target task's capabilities, not the candidate's
  packaging: a server spanning several data sources is covered only where each
  needed capability is. A copy of the candidate itself at another scope is a
  placement question, not an incumbent: where the copies diverge, or the
  operator asked to narrow where it loads, reconcile (ADAPT); only an
  undiverged copy verified to serve this target, with no narrowing asked, is
  recorded as covered. Insufficient verification may mean SKIP pending evidence,
  never a fabricated negative benchmark or a security REJECT.
- **REJECT**: an affirmative disqualifier supported by evidence, such as unsafe
  code, materially refuted claims or dead maintenance. State confidence,
  affected revision/components and the actual defect. Project scope is no
  sandbox.

Roll up counts **per target**, with separate delivery and content verdicts.
Roll up only the targets this run was asked about or inferred; a prior verdict
or another scope's state belongs in the explanation, never as an extra rollup
row that reads as a verdict nobody requested.
A multi-target run shares artifact checks; it does not duplicate every reader.
Triaged-only entries are not deep-vet approvals. Proposed, tested, landed and
runtime-verified are different states, not synonyms for ADOPT.

## Prior verdicts and re-evaluation

Search by candidate/source identity across discovered note locations FIRST,
then check applicability by revision, component, task, scope and runtime.
Reuse verified shared findings, not necessarily a previous fit conclusion.

Every SKIP/REJECT records `Do-not-retry unless:` with observable predicates:
changed candidate behavior, demonstrated new task need, unavailable incumbent,
changed delivery cost, or a supported placement that solves the recorded
objection. Bare time, enthusiasm and repeated asks alone are not evidence.
A new target or task reopens **fit** when it changes those premises: a global
SKIP for cost or no need does not veto a new project. Security findings remain
applicable across targets until their cause is demonstrably removed.

Legacy unscoped notes are evidence leads, not fleet-wide fit verdicts. Record
search gaps and uncertain applicability; do not assert "never vetted" just
because this project's memory has no note. Preserve prior notes and append
corrections with dates rather than silently rewriting their history.

ADOPT/ADAPT also record the inspected revision/content digest and a bounded
review trigger: changed instructions, dependencies, capabilities or permissions;
a changed target task, incumbent or model/runtime that invalidates the test.
Review the changed assumptions, not the entire fleet at every model update.

## Eval note

Land the note where a future vet of that target will search: the target's
discoverable note system, or a stated committed report location when none
exists. The agent's private per-project memory carries a pointer, not the
note, unless the digest verified it is what that target's vets search.
Index/cross-link it. Do not copy private project material into a public
report or global memory.

1. Source identity/revision, evidence links, target(s), concrete use case, and
   run choices: scope chosen/inferred, sweep coverage, landing depth.
2. `Measured, not inferred:` commands/results, model/runtime, tested vs
   inferred controls, incomplete checks and limits of the evidence.
3. Table: component | target | verdict | placement | activation | evidence |
   state. For skipped/rejected rows use no installation as the destination.
4. For proposed changes: rationale, exact permitted files/config, provenance,
   upstream pin, local adaptation, update owner and rollback.
5. Shared artifact findings versus target-specific fit findings, prior notes
   reused, applicability changes and searched/unavailable note locations.
6. Audit dividend and scoped `Do-not-retry unless:` or re-audit triggers.

## Closing checklist

- [ ] Every evaluated component/target has a verdict, evidence status and
      placement/activation or explicit no-install recommendation.
- [ ] Applicable safety findings were retained across targets; overlap claims
      name a covering mechanism actually available in each target.
- [ ] Intended landings were tested with the relevant global/project/nested
      inputs and matching runtime. Visibility, collision and invocation checks
      ran in target and unrelated controls, or are explicitly PARTIAL/unshipped.
- [ ] Applied changes passed the target's review/testing conventions, with
      adversarial review for behavior-shaping ports and measured value or its
      explicit marker. Record proposed/PR/merged/runtime-verified separately.
- [ ] Security-posture proposals — including a target's first
      instruction-loading surface — name their target/config and await required
      authorization. No global enabling, secret access or incidental cleanup
      followed merely from a local adoption recommendation.
- [ ] Diverged copies were diffed and an authoritative copy named; no SKIP
      rests on a diverged or unverified copy of the candidate at another scope.
- [ ] The eval note and triggers exist where promised. Report-only/dry-run
      has no mandatory installs or external issues; issue-only/PR-only work
      records its actual unshipped state. Deferred work is tracked only within
      the authorized landing mode.
- [ ] Claims of shipment cite merged artifacts; tests, drafts and release
      preparation are not deployment evidence.
